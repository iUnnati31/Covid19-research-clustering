## Clustering-COVID-19-Research-Articles

# Overview
This project focuses on clustering COVID-19 research articles using vector embeddings. The goal is to group similar research articles to identify patterns and trends within the literature, facilitating easier discovery of relevant studies.

# Data
The project uses a dataset of COVID-19 research articles, including titles, abstracts, and other metadata. The dataset is preprocessed to generate vector embeddings for each article, representing their content in a high-dimensional space.

# Model
The clustering is performed using clustering algorithm K-Means. Vector embeddings are generated using TF-IDF model to capture the semantic meaning of the articles.

# Usage
- Data Preparation: Ensure the dataset of COVID-19 research articles is in the correct format.
- Vector Embeddings: Use the provided Jupyter notebook or Python script to generate vector embeddings for the articles.
- Clustering: Run the clustering algorithms on the vector embeddings to group similar articles.
- Visualization: Visualize the clustering results to understand the distribution and relationships among the articles.

# Results
The project aims to provide meaningful clusters of COVID-19 research articles, helping researchers and practitioners to quickly find relevant studies and insights.
